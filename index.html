		<h3>Favorite CMSC Subject</h3>
		<p>My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 130. The reason why I like CMSC 130 is that, it does not involve a lot of coding. I'm not really confident with my coding skills as of now. Also, I liked how my former professor taught the subject to us.</p>

		<h3>Favorite GE Subject</h3>
		<p>As of now, my favorite GE subject is PI 10. Although it involves a lot of readings, I liked it because I learned a lot when I took it. Also, my professor taught the subject really well. He also seemed like he really liked teaching about Dr. Jose Rizal. It was a 'breathing' course for me because the workload was not too heavy and I learned a lot when I took this subject.</p>
		
		<br>
		<h3>Favorite Programming Language and why</h3>
		<p>So far, my favorite programming language is Javascript. Like I said in the earlier paragraph, I'm not really good in coding. However, I am most interested to learn Javascript because I'm interested in web development.</p>
		
		<br>
		<h3>Favorite Food</h3>
		<p>I don't usually have a favorite food because it changes depends on my cravings, but while I'm doing this exercise, I'm craving for a Jollihotdog. I haven't eaten it for a while because it is too expensive now...</p>
