				<h3 class="cmsc cmsc-title">Favorite CMSC Subject</h3>
				<p class="cmsc cmsc-text">My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 130. The reason why I like CMSC 130 is that, it does not involve a lot of coding. I'm not really confident with my coding skills as of now. Also, I liked how my former professor taught the subject to us.</p>

				<h3 class="ge ge-title">Favorite GE Subject</h3>
				<p class="ge ge-text">As of now, my favorite GE subject is PI 10. Although it involves a lot of readings, I liked it because I learned a lot when I took it. Also, my professor taught the subject really well. He also seemed like he really liked teaching about Dr. Jose Rizal. It was a 'breathing' course for me because the workload was not too heavy and I learned a lot when I took this subject.</p>

				<h3 class="pl pl-title">Favorite Programming Language and why</h3>

				<h3 class="dream dream-title">Childhood Dream</h3>
				<p class="dream dream-text">As a child, I dreamt of becoming a Computer Engineer because I was inspired by my computer engineer cousins. I also wanted to become a Nurse, but I gave up on that because I was afraid of blood...</p>
